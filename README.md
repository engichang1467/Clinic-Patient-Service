# Walk In Clinic Patient Service

To develop a walk-in clinic patient system software, which is to maintain the medical records for all the patients of the walk-in clinic, and works in both UNIX and Linux.

The walk-in clinic keeps the following information about all its patients: the patient's name (first and last name), address, phone number, email address and care card number.

The walk-in clinic patient system must allow the receptionist to:

1. Add a patient to the database
2. Remove a patient from the database
3. Update a patient's details
4. Check to see if a patient exists
5. Show all patients in the database
6. Exit

$ git clone git@github.com:engichang1467/Clinic-Patient-Service.git
$ cd Clinic-Patient-Service/
```
